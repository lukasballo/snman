def add_edge_lengths(G, precision=3, edges=None):

    Add `length` attribute (in meters) to each edge.

    Vectorized function to calculate great-circle distance between each edge's
    incident nodes. Ensure graph is in unprojected coordinates, and
    unsimplified to get accurate distances.

    Note: this function is run by all the `graph.graph_from_x` functions
    automatically to add `length` attributes to all edges. It calculates edge
    lengths as the great-circle distance from node `u` to node `v`. When
    OSMnx automatically runs this function upon graph creation, it does it
    before simplifying the graph: thus it calculates the straight-line lengths
    of edge segments that are themselves all straight. Only after
    simplification do edges take on a (potentially) curvilinear geometry. If
    you wish to calculate edge lengths later, you are calculating
    straight-line distances which necessarily ignore the curvilinear geometry.
    You only want to run this function on a graph with all straight edges
    (such as is the case with an unsimplified graph).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.MultiDiGraph
        unprojected, unsimplified input graph
    precision : int
        decimal precision to round lengths
    edges : tuple

    If `interpolate` is None, search for the nearest edge to each point, one
