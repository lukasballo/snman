def _is_endpoint(G, node, strict=True):
    """
    Is node a true endpoint of an edge.

    Return True if the node is a "real" endpoint of an edge in the network,
    otherwise False. OSM data includes lots of nodes that exist only as points
    to help streets bend around curves. An end point is a node that either:
    1) is its own neighbor, ie, it self-loops.
    2) or, has no incoming edges or no outgoing edges, ie, all its incident
    edges point inward or all its incident edges point outward.
    3) or, it does not have exactly two neighbors and degree of 2 or 4.

def consolidate_intersections(

):
    """
    Consolidate intersections comprising clusters of nearby nodes.

    Merges nearby nodes and returns either their centroids or a rebuilt graph
    with consolidated intersections and reconnected edge geometries. The
    tolerance argument should be adjusted to approximately match street design
    standards in the specific street network, and you should always use a
    projected graph to work in meaningful and consistent units like meters.
    Note the tolerance represents a per-node buffering radius: for example, to
    consolidate nodes within 10 meters of each other, use tolerance=5.

    When rebuild_graph=False, it uses a purely geometrical (and relatively
    fast) algorithm to identify "geometrically close" nodes, merge them, and
    return just the merged intersections' centroids. When rebuild_graph=True,
    it uses a topological (and slower but more accurate) algorithm to identify
    "topologically close" nodes, merge them, then rebuild/return the graph.
    Returned graph's node IDs represent clusters rather than osmids. Refer to
    nodes' osmid_original attributes for original osmids. If multiple nodes
    were merged together, the osmid_original attribute is a list of merged
    nodes' osmids.

    Divided roads are often represented by separate centerline edges. The
    intersection of two divided roads thus creates 4 nodes, representing where
    each edge intersects a perpendicular edge. These 4 nodes represent a
    single intersection in the real world. A similar situation occurs with
    roundabouts and traffic circles. This function consolidates nearby nodes
    by buffering them to an arbitrary distance, merging overlapping buffers,
    and taking their centroid.

    ----------
    G : networkx.MultiDiGraph
        a projected graph

        geometrically and return the consolidated node points as
        geopandas.GeoSeries
